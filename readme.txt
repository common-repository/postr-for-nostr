Share your WordPress Posts to Nostr with Postr For Nostr ðŸ«‚

== Features ==

* This plugin **works only with NIP-07 browser extensions**. No need to save your private key in WordPress.
* Add your taxonomy terms to the note as tag type `t`.
* Manage relays before postring.

== Demo ==

A demo WordPress installation with Postr For Nostr is available [here](https://postr-for-nostr.joelstuedle.ch/).

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `postr-for-nostr` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the `Plugins` menu in WordPress.

== Usage ==

Logged in users will find a `Post to Nostr` button in the admin column actions (where the `Quick Edit` action is located).

If you want to provide Postr For Nostr to your visitors, simply place a button somewhere in your template. Make sure to add the `postr-for-nostr` class, `data-post-id` and `data-post-type` attribute as shown below.
```
<button type="button" class="postr-for-nostr" data-post-id="[ID]" data-post-type="[POST_TYPE]">Share</button>
```

== Filters ==

**Post Type Filter**

Per default `post`, `page` and all registered custom post types will be allowed to be nostr postred. The allowed post types are filterable with a filter hook:
```
add_filter( 'postr_for_nostr_post_types', function( $post_types ) { 
    // unset('post_type'); 
    return $post_types; 
}, 10, 1 );
```
